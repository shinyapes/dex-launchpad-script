## ðŸŒŒ  DEX Launchpad â€“ Solana Reference

This repository provides reference code for working with Solana Versioned Transactions in the DEX Launchpad.

It demonstrates how to:

- Fetch and resolve Address Lookup Tables (LUTs) used by the DEX.

- Decompile a Solana versioned transaction.

- Reconstruct a transaction from a TransactionMessage using LUTs.

This repo is intended as a developer resource for anyone building tools or integrations with the DEX or other Solana-based projects.

Note: The main implementation code is kept private.
